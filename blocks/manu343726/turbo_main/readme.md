Turbo C++11 Metaprogramming Library
===================================

Turbo testing block. See https://github.com/Manu343726/Turbo for more info.


Description
-----------

This block is used to test the library only. It contains a `main.cpp` with a testing metaprogram and the corresponding
runtime outputs.

Note the default make list was modified to use LLVM/Clang instead of GCC (The default compiler), and to enable C++11 mode.
