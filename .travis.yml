## There are no unit tests currently aviable, except some debugging tests on main.cpp (Unstable and susceptible to be modified
## or even broken). Since this is a C++ metaprogramming library, successfull compilation is interpreted as the tests successfully
## passed (If not, the static asserts fail and the compilation fails).
